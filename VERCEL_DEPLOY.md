# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Instructions

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Your project is now optimized and ready for deployment! Here's what has been fixed and optimized:

### 🔧 Issues Fixed
- ✅ Removed `canvas` dependency (was causing build failures)
- ✅ Removed `pdf2pic` dependency (depends on canvas)
- ✅ Fixed React types version conflicts (updated to v19)
- ✅ Removed `pnpm` configuration for npm consistency
- ✅ Fixed Next.js configuration warnings

### ⚡ Production Optimizations Added
- ✅ Bundle splitting for better caching
- ✅ Security headers (XSS, CSRF protection)
- ✅ Image optimization (WebP/AVIF support)
- ✅ Compression and ETags enabled
- ✅ Package import optimization
- ✅ Bundle analyzer for monitoring

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel (3 Methods)

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production ready with optimizations"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy via Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel auto-detects Next.js settings
   - Click "Deploy"

### Method 2: Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to your Vercel account
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Method 3: Direct Git Deploy

```bash
# If you have Vercel CLI installed
vercel git connect
git push origin main  # Auto-deploys on push
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables Setup

**CRITICAL:** Set these in Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables:

```bash
# Required for AI functionality
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key

# Required for PDF processing
ADOBE_PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=your-adobe-client-id
ADOBE_PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=your-adobe-client-secret

# Required for caching
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-redis-url.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-redis-token

# Required for vector search
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your-pinecone-env
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your-index-name

# Required for authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-string
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

## 📊 Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Build Logs
- Ensure no errors in Vercel deployment logs
- Verify all environment variables are set

### 2. Test Core Functionality
- Upload a PDF document
- Test contract analysis
- Verify API endpoints work

### 3. Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Analyze bundle size locally
npm run build:analyze
```

### 4. Check Security Headers
Use [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com) to verify security headers are working.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Build Fails:**
- Check all environment variables are set in Vercel
- Verify no syntax errors in code

**API Timeouts:**
- Function timeout is set to 30s in `vercel.json`
- For longer operations, consider background jobs

**Large Bundle Size:**
- Run `npm run build:analyze` to identify large dependencies
- Consider code splitting for large components

**Environment Variables Not Working:**
- Ensure they're set in Vercel dashboard, not just locally
- Redeploy after adding new environment variables

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

### Vercel Analytics
- Enable Vercel Analytics in project settings
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track user engagement

### Bundle Analysis
```bash
# Generate bundle analysis report
npm run build:analyze
```

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Once connected to GitHub:
- Every push to `main` branch auto-deploys
- Pull requests create preview deployments
- Rollback available in Vercel dashboard

## 🎯 Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Application loads in ~2-3 seconds
- ✅ PDF upload and analysis works
- ✅ All API endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ Security headers are active
- ✅ Images are optimized (WebP/AVIF)

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test locally with `npm run build && npm start`
4. Consult [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)
